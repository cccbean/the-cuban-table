# the-cuban-table

Going into this project, I've only learned basic HTML and CSS, including the standard and alternative box model, but haven't learned about flexbox or anything like that. I will be taking recipes from "The Cuban Table: A Celebration of Food, Flavors, and History" by Ana Sofia Pelaez and Ellen Silverman.
